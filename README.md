# fusion-experiments

This repository contains code to run experiments for the fusion chapter of my dissertation.

As good practice, make sure to use a virtual environment before installing dependencies and running the code.

Installing Dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Code:

```
python3 run.py
```

After the experiments have finished running (I never ran all of this code together, so my guess is that it takes about 5 hours to run in total),
results should be in the `results` directory, and plots used in the dissertation should be in the `plots` directory.
